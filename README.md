## Overview

I work on systems architecture for composable commerce and AI-enabled platforms.

My focus is on orchestration, determinism, and designing systems that can evolve
without becoming fragile, over-coupled, or difficult to reason about over time.

This profile reflects long-horizon work rather than demos or experiments.

## Projects

These repositories are related parts of a larger architectural exploration:

- **Prism**  
  A long-horizon project exploring composable commerce, orchestration, and AI-native pipelines.

- **Radial Architecture**  
  Essays and patterns for structuring complex systems around domains, contracts, and trust boundaries.

- **Stably**  
  Deterministic pipelines and validation primitives used to enforce predictability in agentic workflows.

- **PromptUI**  
  Contract-driven UI generation and design-system tooling, focused on build-time guarantees.

## Writing

I write in public about systems design, architecture, and long-term maintainability:

## Notes

This profile is intentionally quiet.

Most context lives in the code, the writing, and how the pieces fit together.
